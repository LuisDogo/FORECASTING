# ARIMA models
aim to describe the autocorrelations in the data
## Stationarity & differencing
a stationary time series is one whose statistical properties do not depend on the time in which the series is observed.

*no trend or seasonality*

if $y_t$ is stationary, then $\forall_s $ the distribution of $(y_t, ..., y_{t+s})$ doesn't depend on $t$
