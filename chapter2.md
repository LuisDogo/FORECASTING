# TIME SERIES GRAPHICS
In data analysis we plot first, ask second. <br>
Features seen in plots must be incorporated as much as possible  in the forecasting methods used.
## Variable types
| index | key | value |
|---|---|---|
| recording time | composite id | measured quantity |

for each unique combination of key variables we can create a time series. 
## Time series patterns
- *trend*: long-term direction.
- *season*: unchanging frequency associated with some aspect of the calendar.
- *cycle*:pattern is not a fixed fluctuation.
## Graphs
### Time plots
observations plotted against the time of observation
### Seasonal plots
data is plotted against each individual "season" observed.
the data can have more than one seasonal pattern(season can contain seasons), we can plot according to the granularity required.
### Scatterplots
