# TIME SERIES GRAPHICS
In data analysis we plot first. Ask second Ô∏ª‚î≥‚ïê‰∏Äüí•.<br>
Features seen in plots must be incorporated as much as possible  in the forecasting methods used.
## Variable types
| Index | Key | Value |
|---|---|---|
| recording time | composite id | measured quantity |

for each unique combination of key variables we can create a time series. 
## Time series patterns
- *Trend*: long-term direction.
- *Season*: unchanging frequency associated with some aspect of the calendar.
- *Cycle*: pattern is not a fixed fluctuation.
## Graphs
### Time plots
Observations plotted against the time of observation.
### Seasonal plots
Data is plotted against each individual "season" observed.
the data can have more than one seasonal pattern(season can contain seasons), we can plot according to the granularity required.
### Scatterplots
Explore relationships between time series by plotting them against each other, it's common to compute some correlation coefficient along the scatterplot, the correlation and the scatterplot complement eachother.
### Lag plots
Display the values of the time series at $$y_t$$, plotted against  $$y_{t - k}$$ where k is the lag, these are closely related to *autocorrelation* which measures relationships between lagged values of a time series. $$r_k$$: autocorrelation coefficient for lag $$k$$, the autocorrelation coefficients make up the *AutoCorrelationFunction*.
### ACF plots
Portrays the:
- Trend: positive values that slowly decrease over time as lag increases.
- Seasonality: higher autocorrelations for seasonal lags than for other lags. 
of a time series.
## White noise
Time series that show no autocorrelation. <br>
For "white noise" series we expect  95\% of the spikes of the ACF to lie within $$\pm2\sqrt[2]{T}$$ where: $$T$$ is the length of the time series, if $$1+$$ are outside these bouds or more than 95% of the spikes are outside these bounds , the series is probably not white noise.
