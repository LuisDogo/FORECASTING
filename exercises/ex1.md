1. for cases 3 & 4 list possible predictor variables that might be useful, assuming the relevant data is available.
<br>for exercise 3:
- leasing fees
- car maintance fees
- gas consumption
- de-evaluation of car by brand and model
- dates
- geographical zones
- techinal car sheets
<br>for exercise 4:
- cost of km per passanger class
- national holidays
- sports events
- weather conditions
2. for case 3, describe the 5 steps of forecasting in the context of this project.
    1. the forecast will be used to predict vehicle sales
    2. *statistical*: vehicle technical sheets, amount of cars leased & sold, bought and sold prices, leasing costs, car expenses. *expertise*: what costumers value more in a car and how much they are willing to pay.
    3. graph a waterfall plot for all the revenue entries and one aggregate, see the correlation between car features and leasing/sold frequency.
    4. test a time series, explanatory model & mixture model to see which one works best and adjust their respective hyperparameters.
    5. predict 1 moth in advance in week intervals to see how the model performed and keep track of it.
